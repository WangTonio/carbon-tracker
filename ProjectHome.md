# Overview #
This app was developed as part of a small research project at the German University of GÃ¶ttingen.
It measures the amount of CO2 emitted by a car in an accurate way.
This is achieved by using the On Board Diagnostics II - interface, which is made available to the Android phone by a suitable OBD-to-Bluetooth-adapter.
The app is supposed to run while driving and takes combustion-related data-"snapshots" combined with GPS coordinates and time stamps.
Tuples of raw data are uploaded to a server based on a local caching policy.
The server stores the raw data in a relational data base and provides a web interface for detailed analysis regarding when, where and how CO2 was emitted.


# Technical Infrastructure #
The Android app is targeted at version 2.3 due to some serious issues we encountered with the Bluez-Bluetooth stack of the previous version.
The server is composed of a web interface implemented in Java Server Faces (JSF) 1.2 and a REST-based interface implemented with plain-old Servlets; both running on Tomcat 6.
The data is stored in a MySQL-DB. Note that the server part is not open source but a deployed version can be accessed freely under http://134.76.21.30/CarbonTrackerWS.

# Basis #
Our work is based on:
  * this pretty cool (but undocumented) app http://code.google.com/p/android-obd-reader/
  * this conference paper http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5718558

# Organization / Contribution #
The project is not maintained anymore, but the final version is regarded stable. Anyone interested is free to pick up the code base.

# Warning / Disclaimer #
Depending on your country, it might be illegal to interfere with the OBD interface while driving. Also, there is absolutely no warranty (see license) and we are not accountable
